/*
  malloc(size_t n)
  Returns a pointer to a newly allocated chunk of at least n bytes, or
  null if no space is available, in which case errno is set to ENOMEM
  on ANSI C systems.

  If n is zero, malloc returns a minimum-sized chunk. (The minimum
  size is 16 bytes on most 32bit systems, and 32 bytes on 64bit
  systems.)  Note that size_t is an unsigned type, so calls with
  arguments that would be negative if signed are interpreted as
  requests for huge amounts of space, which will often fail. The
  maximum supported value of n differs across systems, but is in all
  cases less than the maximum representable value of a size_t.

CORE_API void* dlmalloc(size_t);

/*
  free(void* p)
  Releases the chunk of memory pointed to by p, that had been previously
  allocated using malloc or a related routine such as realloc.
  It has no effect if p is null. If p was not malloced or already
  freed, free(p) will by default cause the current program to abort.
*/

/*
  calloc(size_t n_elements, size_t element_size);
  Returns a pointer to n_elements * element_size bytes, with all locations
  set to zero.

/*
  realloc(void* p, size_t n)
  Returns a pointer to a chunk of size n that contains the same data
  as does chunk p up to the minimum of (n, p's size) bytes, or null
  if no space is available.

  The returned pointer may or may not be the same as p. The algorithm
  prefers extending p in most cases when possible, otherwise it
  employs the equivalent of a malloc-copy-free sequence.

  If p is null, realloc is equivalent to malloc.

  If space is not available, realloc returns null, errno is set (if on
  ANSI) and p is NOT freed.

  if n is for fewer bytes than already held by p, the newly unused
  space is lopped off and freed if possible.  realloc with a size
  argument of zero (re)allocates a minimum-sized chunk.

  The old unix realloc convention of allowing the last-free'd chunk
  to be used as an argument to realloc is not supported.

  realloc_in_place(void* p, size_t n)
  Resizes the space allocated for p to size n, only if this can be
  done without moving p (i.e., only if there is adjacent space
  available if n is greater than p's current allocated size, or n is
  less than or equal to p's size). This may be used instead of plain
  realloc if an alternative allocation strategy is needed upon failure
  to expand space; for example, reallocation of a buffer that must be
  memory-aligned or cleared. You can use realloc_in_place to trigger
  these alternatives only when needed.

  Returns p if successful; otherwise null.

/*
  memalign(size_t alignment, size_t n);
  Returns a pointer to a newly allocated chunk of n bytes, aligned
  in accord with the alignment argument.

  The alignment argument should be a power of two. If the argument is
  not a power of two, the nearest greater power is used.
  8-byte alignment is guaranteed by normal malloc calls, so don't
  bother calling memalign with an argument of 8 or less.

  Overreliance on memalign is a sure way to fragment space.

  Allocates a chunk of n bytes, aligned in accord with the alignment
  argument. Differs from memalign only in that it (1) assigns the
  allocated memory to *pp rather than returning it, (2) fails and
  returns EINVAL if the alignment is not a power of two (3) fails and
  returns ENOMEM if memory cannot be allocated.

  valloc(size_t n);
  Equivalent to memalign(pagesize, n), where pagesize is the page
  size of the system. If the pagesize is unknown, 4096 is used.

/*
  mallopt(int parameter_number, int parameter_value)
  Sets tunable parameters The format is to provide a
  (parameter-number, parameter-value) pair.  mallopt then sets the
  corresponding parameter to the argument value if it can (i.e., so
  long as the value is meaningful), and returns 1 if successful else
  0.  To workaround the fact that mallopt is specified to use int,
  not size_t parameters, the value -1 is specially treated as the
  maximum unsigned size_t value.

  SVID/XPG/ANSI defines four standard param numbers for mallopt,
  normally defined in malloc.h.  None of these are use in this malloc,
  so setting them has no effect. But this malloc also supports other
  options in mallopt. See below for details.  Briefly, supported
  parameters are as follows (listed defaults are for "typical"
  configurations).

  Symbol            param #  default    allowed param values
  M_TRIM_THRESHOLD     -1   2*1024*1024   any   (-1 disables)
  M_GRANULARITY        -2     page size   any power of 2 >= page size
  M_MMAP_THRESHOLD     -3      256*1024   any   (or 0 if no MMAP support)

  Returns the number of bytes obtained from the system.  The total

  rounding to an enforceable limit; this actual value is returned.
  Using an argument of the maximum possible size_t effectively
  disables checks. If the argument is less than or equal to the
  current malloc_footprint, then all future allocations that require
  additional system memory will fail. However, invocation cannot
  retroactively deallocate existing used memory.
